# My Biggest Success
## Connections & Relationships

From the very start of this program, our CSU professors stressed that **relationships with students come first**. I've taken that to heart and really focused on building relationships and genuine connection with my students, and honestly the extent to which I've been able to connect to my students has surprised me.

Here are some of my favorite memories captured in photos:

### One more thing...

I would be remiss not to mention the connections I've made with other educators in the cohort. We have had so many great times together, but this is one of my favorites:

# My Biggest Challenge
## Learning the Ins and Outs of Grading

Oh grading... You'd think it would be simple, but no, it's complicated, time consuming, and done a little differently by every educator. Student teaching has given me chance to try using [_equitable grading practices_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40363882-grading-for-equity) in the classroom, but it's not without some struggle. Ultimately, I'm sharing these classes with my mentor teachers, which means we have to combine our grading styles, instructional practices, and assignment ideas in ways that honor both of our personalities. At times, this has left me wondering a few things:

<img class="inline-image right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gfe.png" alt="Grading for Equity book cover.">

- What do our grades in this class really represent? Are our assignments, and the following grades, really measuring learning and understanding?
- Do we need so many assignments in this class? Do students find this to just be busy work?
- How do I build more intrinsic motivation in students with the curriculum we are using for this course?

I really want to honor the ideas described in the book _Grading for Equity_, but this puts me in the minority of teachers in this regard. These are teachers that I respect and I trust—and teachers that have read this book!—but in practice they've found that enforcing some more restrictive grading practices help students get things done. Where does that leave me? Which equitable grading practices have been working and which have not? These are all questions I'm working through.

# My Biggest Learning
## Adapting Instructional Style to the Students

Recognizing that each student enters the classroom with unique learning styles, backgrounds, and needs, I've learned to effectively adapt my instructional techniques to honor both the students and the content. The biggest example of this has been in AP Computer Science A, a college-level programming course (read: difficult!) with mostly seniors and a few juniors. The course was not going poorly by any measure, students were generally doing well and getting the content as it was presented to them, but I noticed some students struggled to get started on lab assignments.

After some probing questions, these students expressed to me that they felt like they were understanding lectures, but couldn't put this learning into practice on their own computers. They understood the conceptual information being presented, but _also_ needed some guided practice writing out some code **with me**.

I was **SO** excited that they shared this feedback with me (and I think they only did so because of the rapport we built—a.k.a. my biggest success), and from that moment on, I acted on their feedback and completely changed the instructional model I was using in the course:

- I moved from delivering short lectures off of the computer (a technique that is a must for younger students, lest they be distracted by all the shiny things they can access on the computers), to delivering all lectures _through_ the computer on Google Meet.
- On the Meet call, students can follow along on their own computers while I simultaneously a) move through the slide decks and b) actually type out code examples in the slides.
- I host the Google Meet on my laptop, which allows me to move around the room and make sure everyone is right there with me following along.

This toggling back and forth from my code editor to the slides, all while the students follow along with my code, is essentially a form of _pair-programming_, a common practice where two or more people collaborate on some code together. Using this technique has dramatically helped my students take what they've learned from lectures and **immediately** apply it to the lab assignments. I'm happy, they're happy. It's been a huge success. My mentor teacher even said he would adopt this strategy in coming years because it has worked so well. Awesome!

## Learning is Cool

Well friends, I hope my reflections inspire fellow educators, both new and experienced, to embrace the messy, beautiful process of teaching and learning, knowing that every challenge offers a chance to grow. Students are cool, teaching is cool, and learning is cool.
