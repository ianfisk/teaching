## Reflection on the Year

There are so many things I’m proud about from the past year, but the relationships I have cultivated with my students stand out significantly. Beyond the transmission of knowledge, the connections forged within the classroom environment are a source of deep satisfaction. Furthermore, witnessing my students' accomplishments, while not solely attributable to my efforts, provides a powerful feedback loop that reinforces the value and impact of the learning experiences we share. This positive cycle instills confidence in my pedagogical approaches and the lessons I’ve delivered to my classes. Finally, the Computer Science content I have developed for my classes is a point of pride, representing the tangible outcomes of my efforts to create engaging and effective learning materials, coupled with the expertise I bring from industry experience. It is very rewarding to see my circuitous path to teaching pay off in this regard. Underpinning all of this is the daily enthusiasm and energy that I receive from teaching and working with students, fueling my commitment and passion.

Conversely, several challenges have presented themselves. Time management consistently proves to be a hurdle, particularly in balancing the various day-to-day demands of teaching. The desire to create high-quality content often clashes with the finite nature of time, especially when paired with the daily grading load. Similarly, carving out sufficient time for thoughtful reflection, crucial for the ongoing improvement of curriculum and classroom dynamics, was a challenge for me in the first half of student teaching because I was so busy with other things. Lastly, the ongoing endeavor to build a positive classroom culture and foster a sense of community within the computer lab requires consistent effort and attention. It is far too easy for students to goof off on the computers and lose all interest in paying attention for the day, which is a problem made worse by the fact most of the students in the room face towards a wall, so it’s difficult to see their faces and make a personal connection. This problem compounded the issue of trying to motivate students who already actively resist engagement with their studies.

I have seen the most growth over the last year in my pedagogical knowledge.Through exposure to frameworks like UbD and CSU’s lesson planning process, I have developed a more systematic approach to curriculum development, ensuring a clear connection between content and relevant standards. My understanding of available resources has also expanded (digital tools, physical activities, content standards, etc.), allowing for more effective and engaging instructional design. Another significant area of growth has been my ability to provide direct feedback and course-correct student behaviors in the moment. I have become more comfortable addressing issues in non-punitive, proactive ways, a shift from my previously more conflict-averse disposition.

Looking back, one minor aspect I would have approached differently would have been to gain more experience in a math class. Specifically, I would have valued the chance to sit in on more than the handful of math classes I observed, and perhaps even teach a math class during my student teaching. It ultimately will be of little consequence, since I will be teaching nothing but Computer Science next year, but I believe this experience would have provided invaluable insights into teaching a core subject that often evokes negative perceptions from students. However, on the whole, I am proud of the work I have accomplished in the past year and my consistent dedication to my students, and there are no significant things I would have done differently.

Two key areas of growth I have identified are increasing my knowledge of trauma-informed teaching and developing more robust classroom management strategies plus detailed lesson plans I’ll need to use in a middle school class I’ll be teaching. To increase my knowledge of trauma-informed teaching and building more emotional intelligence, I’ve already started reading the books The Courageous Classroom: Creating a Culture of Safety for Students to Learn and Thrive and To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher. From that base of knowledge, I plan to seek out any available PD classes and books related to this subject. Regarding my desire to improve my readiness for the brutal realities of teaching middle school (I kid, I’m actually stoked for it!), I will do a lot of forward planning this summer to make my life easier during the school year. Furthermore, I am already leveraging materials and expertise some cohort members have developed over the last year of teaching in middle school classrooms. While I aspire to excel in my first year, I also acknowledge that successfully navigating the initial year will be a significant achievement in itself. Given that I will be the sole Computer Science teacher, establishing some sort of support network will be a priority. This includes proactively engaging with administrators, my mentor teacher, and other science educators to foster collaboration and shared learning. A final area of growth I’ll dedicate some time to is in introducing AI to the Computer Science curriculum. Colorado’s new standards require that this be taught in some capacity, so I’m already brainstorming ways to introduce this topic to my classes.

My perspectives on teaching have evolved in notable ways since the beginning of the program. Reflecting on my initial educational philosophy hit list, some core tenets have remained consistent, such as focusing on building a growth mindset, creating an environment and content that naturally develops intrinsic motivation in students, and my focus on maintaining some fun and levity in the classroom. However, I now recognize that my first priority in the classroom is to build relationships with and among my students. From this community foundation, all else will follow. Furthermore, my stance on technology in the classroom, specifically cell phones, has hardened considerably. Influenced by my own experiences and learnings from The Anxious Generation book, I am now much more inclined towards a strict no-phones policy in the classroom, if that is a supported policy in the school. If that is not adopted school-wide, it’s much harder to be the odd one out, so I will use some compromise. I truly want to give students plenty of agency to live their life, their way, but I now recognize the importance of allowing this freedom within reasonable bounds that better support young adult development.

One more question has been bouncing around in my head for the better part of this year: Am I a software engineer that teaches Computer Science, or am I a teacher first and foremost? I.e., what is my identity? Initially, I struggled with identifying as a Computer Science teacher, let alone identifying as a teacher in general (without any emphasis on my area of expertise). A part of me wasn’t ready to switch away from being a software engineer because I felt like I was giving up on my career and all the work I put into it. Losing that identity was scary, and I wasn’t ready for that change. After this year of teaching, I’m leaning much more heavily to not only seeing myself as an Computer Science educator first and foremost, but as a general teacher of kids. In other words, I enjoy teaching so much that, while honoring my past experience remains crucial, the well-being and holistic development of my students has become increasingly central to my identity, and I have honestly been happy to teach any subject because, well, I’m still teaching. I’m making a huge difference in my students’ lives, and that has nothing to do with a specific subject or standard.

## I used to be… Now I am…

1. I used to be someone that saw the glass half empty, a complete reversal of my optimistic younger self! Now I am someone that sees the glass as half full, with so much room for potential growth. Working with youth, and being surrounded by their inherent optimism, has brought my world view back into a place I want it to be.
1. I used to be someone that shied away from the spotlight and public speaking, and I feared that this would be something that I would have a hard time overcoming in the classroom. Now I am confident in my comfort in front of the class, and overcoming this insecurity has given me confidence to keep pushing my comfort levels in other areas of growth.
1. I used to be someone that only dreamed about living a simpler, more wholesome life where I give more back to my community. Now I am someone that is realizing that dream and actually living that life.
1. I used to think teaching was all about preparing the perfect lessons, the perfect assignments, and overall being someone that doesn’t make mistakes. Teachers, in my younger eyes, seemed to be perfect. Now I am someone that knows it’s ok not to have everything planned out to the nth degree, and it’s natural to make mistakes. Students are so hungry for growth and learning, and if anything, providing them an authentic view into my own learning and development builds a better environment for us all.
1. I used to think an educator prep program would mainly be about going over concrete thinking routines or teaching methods. Now I understand that teaching methods is only a small part of a master’s program. The most important part has been getting us into classrooms as soon as possible, coupled with a supportive environment that is conducive to our growth.
1. I used to think teaching was mostly about being a “sage on stage” leader, and I worried about my ability to lead a class in other, more meaningful ways. Now I am someone that loves to be the “guide on the side” in a classroom, and to create dynamic environments where students can take charge of their own learning.
1. I used to be one that naturally found faults in all aspects of life—a side effect of working in engineering, where we are trained to use a critical lens when looking at a product, system, code, etc. Now I am someone who sees the beauty in creations and celebrates the intrinsic value present in anything someone creates. Instead of thinking how I might do it differently, I celebrate the unique aspects of personality that come through in a piece of work.
1. I used to think that teaching wouldn’t satisfy my desire to solve hard problems and create tangible solutions. Now I know that, while the problems are usually of a different nature, it is full of complex scenarios that require skill and expertise to navigate. An added bonus is the solutions have a large, meaningful impact directly on others, something that I was missing before now.
1. I used to struggle with maintaining motivation and drive in my career. Now I am brimming with enthusiasm and a desire to make every single day rock. My work is meaningful, and it fuels me.
1. I used to worry that teaching full-time would be a large emotional drain. Now I know that working with youth in such a dynamic way actually gives me more energy than I could ever imagine, even on the hard days.
1. I used to wonder about difficulty in connecting with students. Now I am confident in my ability to form relationships with my students. I am someone that my students look forward to seeing everyday.
1. I used to be someone that avoided slowing down and sitting with my thoughts, mainly out of a mixture of fear and ignorance. Now I am someone that embraces reflection and time to cultivate mindfulness. I welcome opportunities to build my emotional intelligence.

## My Fuel

Building relationships with my students, having fun, and watching learning take place are the things that fuel me the most. I know, and I can see, that I’m making a difference in my students’ lives. That is incredibly exciting and an excellent motivator every day.
