## _Teachers demonstrate mastery of and pedagogical expertise in the content they teach._

### Element A – _Teachers provide instruction that is aligned with the Colorado Academic Standards, their District’s organized plan of instruction, and the individual needs of their students._

I incorporate backwards design into all of my lesson and unit planning, and for me, this process starts by looking at Colorado’s Academic Standards, identifying which standards I need to meet in a given lesson/unit, and thinking about performance tasks I’ll use to assess students’ learning.

Pictured above are example learning targets for a lesson I developed to teach students about client-server architecture on the internet. To keep things fun, this lesson was developed around a project where students created and deployed their own versions of Wordle. The idea for this lab came to me after noticing that nearly all of my students liked the game, so why not take this interest and use it as an opportunity to teach the class about web development and internet architecture?

### Element B – _Teachers develop and implement lessons that connect to a variety of content areas/disciplines and emphasize literacy and mathematical practices._

### Element C – _Teachers demonstrate knowledge of the content, central concepts, inquiry, appropriate evidence-based instructional practices, and specialized characteristics of the disciplines being taught._

Following obtaining my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, I pursued a career in software engineering, gaining practical experience that informs my current teaching practice. This culminated with my work for Google—known for its engineering prowess.

I consider both my degree in the field and my work experience to be essential to my success delivering an educational experience that is approachable to all learners, especially with the abstract concepts that lie at the heart of Computer Science. I also consider my practical experience to be something that distinguishes me from other Computer Science/CTE educators, and I’ve found that I absolutely love using my expertise to create customized instruction and projects for my students (much like the Wordle project mentioned above).

My transition into teaching is something I see as the perfect application of the knowledge I’ve gained studying and working as an engineer. Teaching gives me an outlet to give back to the community in a tangible way, making an impact that matters more than, say, managing servers and looking at application usage metrics.
