Tenets of my educational philosophy:

1. I believe the purposes of education are to give young adults the confidence, knowledge, and skills that will support them in their future endeavors, whatever their paths might be.
1. I believe that educators should honor a student’s individuality and unique path through school and life.
1. I believe that building engagement, interest, and community in students is key to constructing a good learning environment.
1. I believe in developing a growth mindset in students and myself. Educators should develop a professional disposition of continuous learning.
1. I believe teachers should display these characteristics: empathy, genuine excitement towards getting to know their students, grit, resourcefulness, leadership, and a growth mindset.
1. I believe that students should have fun in school, and play should be built into the curriculum.
1. I believe in building a safe space where open and honest communication can be done in a respectful manner.
1. I believe in celebrating failure as a learning opportunity, and using teaching practices that avoid penalizing students for doing what every learner does: make mistakes.
1. I believe in using technology in the classroom in a thoughtful way that supports the learning journey without wholesale replacing the journey.
1. I believe in developing an openness in thought that allows for critical thinking, analysis, and respectful discourse of differing sides of a topic.
1. I believe students should have access to a robust Computer Science education in public schools so they can develop numeracy, literacy, and problem solving skills that are crucial in today’s age of technology.

**TL;DR:** Focus on relationships, cultivate a growth mindset, develop grit, be a problem solver, and have fun. Oh, and public schools rock!
