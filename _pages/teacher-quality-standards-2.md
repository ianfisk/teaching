In January and February, I actively engaged in Rocky's Back to School Night and Parent/Teacher Conferences. My mentor-teacher and I employed a collaborative approach to leading these meetings, ensuring both of our perspectives on individual student progress were shared authentically with parents.

Back to School Night and Parent/Teacher Conferences provided invaluable opportunities to establish positive relationships with families. These events allowed me to introduce myself, learn about families' backgrounds and perspectives, and create a welcoming environment where parents could get to know me. My goal was to build trust and confidence in my role as a student teacher and in my instructional plans. These initial connections proved essential in cultivating open communication and ultimately allowed me to better support the success of my students.
