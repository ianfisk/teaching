## _Teachers establish a safe, inclusive and respectful learning environment for a diverse population of students._

### Element A

> Teachers foster a predictable learning environment characterized by acceptable student behavior and efficient use of time in which each student has a positive, nurturing relationship with caring adults and peers.

TODO: Luigi and Waluigi? OR picture of me helping Ben and Grayson on the computer.

<br>

### Element B

> Teachers demonstrate an awareness of, a commitment to, and a respect for multiple aspects of diversity, while working toward common goals as a community of learners.

### Element C

> Teachers engage students as individuals, including those with diverse needs and interests, across a range of ability levels by adapting their teaching for the benefit of all students.

TODO: Adapting curriculum so every student can see themselves in my course, even CS course. Adapting curriculum to accomodate students on IEPs in Game Design A. Food Truck Capstone project.
NOT Wordle lab bc I've already mentioned that a ton.

#### My favorite student quotes

>You're a baddy, Mr. Fisk. - Brianna

>You and Mr. Lyell are **top**, Mr. Fisk. - Evonie

<br>

### Element D â€“ _Teachers work collaboratively with the families and/or significant adults for the benefit of students._

In January and February, I actively engaged in Rocky's Back to School Night and Parent/Teacher Conferences. My mentor-teacher and I employed a collaborative approach to leading these meetings, ensuring both of our perspectives on individual student progress were shared authentically with parents.

Back to School Night and Parent/Teacher Conferences provided invaluable opportunities to establish positive relationships with families. These events allowed me to introduce myself, learn about families' backgrounds and perspectives, and create a welcoming environment where parents could get to know me. My goal was to build trust and confidence in my role as a student teacher and in my instructional plans. These initial connections proved essential in cultivating open communication and ultimately allowed me to better support the success of my students.
