## _Teachers establish a safe, inclusive and respectful learning environment for a diverse population of students._

### Element A

> Teachers foster a predictable learning environment characterized by acceptable student behavior and efficient use of time in which each student has a positive, nurturing relationship with caring adults and peers.

Predictability in the classroom is so important for student success, cultivating a positive classroom culture, and even for planning efficiency. In an Intro to Business class, we use daily warm-up videos plus discussion to introduce some structure and routine into every lesson, to help focus students’ minds into the right headspace for the day, and also to introduce current business events into the curriculum. This image shows a few example videos we used in different weeks, and possible discussion questions tied to the videos. Students expressed value in this routine because it helps them transition from passing period to class time, and they enjoyed knowing more about current world events. It is also fun for me to find videos related to current news or various business happenings that are on my mind.

### Element B

> Teachers demonstrate an awareness of, a commitment to, and a respect for multiple aspects of diversity, while working toward common goals as a community of learners.

Pictured above is a slide from a DEIA workshop me and other Rocky staff took part in during a professional development day. I believe in maintaining a strong commitment to DEIA initiatives in all parts of life, and part of that is always being open to new learning experiences with respect to this topic. My goal is to educate myself so that I can better serve my students and community. During this workshop, me and my table group discussed how we honor DEIA in our classrooms. It was a great experience for me to learn from seasoned teachers, and I was able to share about my experiences working and volunteering with equity initiatives and diverse groups in my time before teaching.

### Element C

> Teachers engage students as individuals, including those with diverse needs and interests, across a range of ability levels by adapting their teaching for the benefit of all students.

#### My favorite student quotes

>You're a baddy, Mr. Fisk. - Brianna

>You and Mr. Lyell are **top**, Mr. Fisk. - Evonie

Connecting with my students is a priority of mine. It has unlocked more meaningful connections in the classroom, and has helped me be a better educator. I’ve found that these relationships have allowed for students to tell me what is/is not working in the class, which has been invaluable feedback for my classes. I’m also able to adapt my curriculum to individual class’s interests by introducing projects that I know my students will be stoked on, and I’m able to quickly modify curriculum for students that need it. My ultimate goal is to meet my students where they are on any given day, and ensure that every student can see some aspect of themselves in my course, even if it’s a technical Computer Science class.

I picked these student quotes for my artifact, since they capture the fun, relaxed relationship I’ve had with students throughout this year. Even though we have fun, students know that I have high expectations, and our positive relationship helps students be intrinsically motivated to live up to my expectations. Building relationships with my students has been easy for me to do, and it has allowed me to really _teach_ my students on another level.

### Element D – _Teachers work collaboratively with the families and/or significant adults for the benefit of students._

In January and February, I actively engaged in Rocky's Back to School Night and Parent/Teacher Conferences. My mentor-teacher and I employed a collaborative approach to leading these meetings, ensuring both of our perspectives on individual student progress were shared authentically with parents.

Back to School Night and Parent/Teacher Conferences provided invaluable opportunities to establish positive relationships with families. These events allowed me to introduce myself, learn about families' backgrounds and perspectives, and create a welcoming environment where parents could get to know me. My goal was to build trust and confidence in my role as a student teacher and in my instructional plans. These initial connections proved essential in cultivating open communication and ultimately allowed me to better support the success of my students.
