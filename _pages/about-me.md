My desire to change careers into teaching has been a personal odyssey many years in the making. It has been a decision that, at times, keeps me up at night, sparking in me fears of the unknown, and yet at other times it feels like the only right path to take. I am a professional software engineer turned Computer Science teacher, and I am coming from working in the world of Big Tech–most recently I was at Google. It is the job that I literally dreamed about in university, but even after achieving this ultimate career goal I was not happy. {% include pullquote.html quote="I wasn’t satisfied with my place in the community, I wasn’t satisfied with my place in such a big corporation, and I didn’t feel like I was helping people." %}

My goal of becoming a teacher stems from my love of community and the desire to perform a job where I feel like I am able to make a meaningful impact in a local community.  If there is anything I’ve learned so far in my personal and professional life, it’s that I like to help people, I love creating an environment of learning for myself and others, and I enjoy fostering fun and inclusive communities. I believe teaching is the perfect place I can build upon these goals.

I grew up in a small, rural town in Washington state, and because of this upbringing I am particularly passionate about these types of areas. I always looked up to my teachers with esteem and really saw them as integral members of our community. My dad also worked in a variety of capacities at the school, so I saw firsthand the positive impact one can have on kids’ lives. Unfortunately, rural areas often have fewer course offerings in the realm of technology education. I had no introduction to Computer Science until my junior year at university, and nobody in my hometown, including myself, would have guessed I would go from there to working at a company like Google. My goal is to show students that anything is possible and to support them in whatever way will help them achieve their goals.

Over the years of my professional career, I have explored my desire to work in education by seeking out opportunities to work with individuals in an educational capacity. This includes hosting numerous college student interns for a summer and formally mentoring new team members starting their first job out of college. I have also had opportunities to work with high school students exploring a career in technology. To give back to my community at large, I have volunteered for the last few years with a Seattle-based non-profit, Peace Peloton, which aims to boost local minority-owned businesses through bicycle-centric events. Here in Colorado, I’ve had a blast volunteering with SendTown Bike Club as a coach to middle schoolers learning to mountain bike.

Career changes are always periods filled with unknowns, but I’m choosing to focus more on my excitement towards the upcoming changes in my life and my career. I was filled with the most joy at work when I was helping new team members succeed and walking through complicated code with other people, and this mentoring experience has helped me realize education is where my passion lies. That, and my time volunteering in the community and learning at Colorado State University in the M.Ed. program, has helped reassure me that education is where I’m supposed to be.
