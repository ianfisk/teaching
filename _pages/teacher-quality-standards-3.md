## _Teachers plan and deliver effective instruction and create an environment that facilitates learning for their students._

### Element A

> Teachers demonstrate knowledge about the ways in which learning takes place, including the levels of intellectual, physical, social, and emotional development of their students.

### Element B

> Teachers use formal and informal methods to assess student learning, provide feedback, and use results to inform planning and instruction.

### Element C – _Teachers integrate and utilize appropriate available technology to engage students in authentic learning experiences._

In the AP Computer Science A class I taught, some students gave me some valuable feedback early on about missing some of the big picture when it comes to writing programs in Java. They expressed that they were understanding lectures and demos I would do in front of the class, but then felt stuck when attempting to start on projects independently. They were overwhelmed by the steep learning curve of this college-level course.

To help students work through this gap in understanding, I came up with a plan to introduce more hands-on instruction where the students could program _alongside me_ while I explained my thought process on how to approach problems using the tools we were learning about in the course.

The technology I used to facilitate this was Google Meet–I would start a meeting, share my screen, and have students follow along on their own machines as we did some programming together or walked through some project code we would supply to students. This setup allowed for a perfect mixture of pair programming and worked examples, and it was a great help at closing the knowledge gap expressed by students while also providing entertaining, differentiated instruction.

In almost all the classes I taught, it wasn’t hard to introduce technological tools into the curriculum. Part of Computer Science education is, after all, actually running programs on computers! Doing this requires using a suite of development tools that most students were not familiar with before the class. Not only did using Google Meet allow me to support my students’ first steps as new programmers, it also allowed them to see how an experienced developer interacts with development tools. Both of these outcomes were a huge help to my students.
