## _Teachers demonstrate professionalism through ethical conduct, reflection, and leadership._

### Element A – _Teachers demonstrate high standards for professional conduct._

This photo shows me and fellow business teacher Lynne Lyell chaperoning the FBLA district competition in Greeley, CO. I attended this event to gain experience working with FBLA, but also because my years of corporate experience allowed me to be a positive role model for students. During this event, I was able to meet and share my experience with many students I haven’t had directly in a class.

### Element B – _Teachers link professional growth to their professional goals._

Even though I'm just finishing my M.Ed. program at CSU, I’m already thinking about the future and the possibility of getting a Master’s in Computer Science. This will not only give me lots of very fun professional development that will directly impact my CS curriculum, but will also allow me to teach more concurrent enrollment courses, a goal of mine in the next few years. My mentor teacher, Chance Mazzia, speaks highly of this program at Georgia Tech, so I will likely enroll in this within the year.

### Element C – _Teachers respond to a complex, dynamic environment._

I’m honestly not really sure what artifact to use for this standard, nor do I necessarily think it needs an artifact. If you have any experience working in a high school, you know how every day is different—there are highs, lows, and everything in between. This image was shared to me by a student because, well, it’s hilarious, but I think it captures some of the chaos, weirdness, hairstyles, and levity experienced everyday at school.

### Element D – _Teachers demonstrate leadership in the school, the community, and the teaching profession._

Nearly the whole school year, I’ve been advocating for a specific software development tool to be unlocked for us to use in the classroom. These discussions took place between me and an IT manager in the district, my mentor teacher, and some other business teachers within the district. This screenshot is showing an email between me and a business teacher from Timnath Middle/High talking about the tool and the possibility of using it. It’s hard for student teachers to make a meaningful impact in their schools, but this was an area that I could at least help communicate to district admin the importance of this tool and its ubiquitous use in professional engineering workflows.
