Colorado created a [State Model Evaluation System](https://www.cde.state.co.us/educatoreffectiveness/smes-teacher) for teachers that can be used to measure a teacher's professional development and student learning over time. Colorado State University's Center for Educator Preparation (CEP) has "adapated these standards to reflect the specific context and opportunities available to teacher candidates" in the program (Colorado State University, 2021). CEP's quality standards evaluate two categoriesâ€“the act of teaching and continuous improvement.

Please explore the linked standards below for my reflections on the standards and evidence how I met these standards in the classroom.

### The Act of Teaching

- [Standard I: _Teachers demonstrate mastery of and pedagogical expertise in the content they teach._]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/one)
- [Standard II: _Teachers establish a safe, inclusive and respectful learning environment for a diverse  population of students._]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/two)
- [Standard III: _Teachers plan and deliver effective instruction and create an environment that  facilitates learning for their students._]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/three)

### Continuous Improvement

- [Standard IV: _Teachers demonstrate professionalism through ethical conduct, reflection, and leadership._]({{ site.baseurl }}/standards/four)
